# napari-organoidtracker

Allows you to load OrganoidTracker files into Napari. Right now, only the tracks can be loaded, position metadata is ignored. Feel free to contribute to the project.

The plugin is only for viewing OrganoidTracker data, you cannot track new data with it or edit existing data. For that, you'll need to use the OrganoidTracker software itself, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jvzonlab/OrganoidTracker).
